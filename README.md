# Interaction-Modeling-2D-Transformations
The Project Purposes: 1. Building interactive applications 2. Learning how to model simple geometric objects 3. Learning how to implement 2D transformations  - Resolution: Theta angle (Figure 2 â€“ right-bottom) to determine the resolution of the vertices in ellipse. - X-radius: Radius of the ellipse in x direction. - Y-radius: Radius of the ellipse in y direction. - Color1: Passing the color obtained from sliders to the fragment shader to determine the color of the diamonds - Color2: Passing the color obtained from sliders to the fragment shader to determine the color of the ellipse. - Position: Performing 2D translation according to X and Y slider values. - Scale: Scaling the size of the shapes according to the slider values. - Rotation: Rotating the shapes in z-axis according to the slider values.
