# Interaction-Modeling-2D-Transformations
<b>The Project Purposes: </b> <br />
1. Building interactive applications <br />
2. Learning how to model simple geometric objects <br />
3. Learning how to implement 2D transformations  <br />
- Resolution: Theta angle to determine the resolution of the vertices in ellipse. <br />
- X-radius: Radius of the ellipse in x direction. <br />
- Y-radius: Radius of the ellipse in y direction. <br />
- Color1: Passing the color obtained from sliders to the fragment shader to determine the color of the diamonds <br />
- Color2: Passing the color obtained from sliders to the fragment shader to determine the color of the ellipse. <br />
- Position: Performing 2D translation according to X and Y slider values. <br />
- Scale: Scaling the size of the shapes according to the slider values. <br / >
- Rotation: Rotating the shapes in z-axis according to the slider values.
